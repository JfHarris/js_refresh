Bowling kata---TDD refresher

Bowling scoring:
Each game is 10 frames with two rolls in each frame.
Goal is to knock down all 10 pins
Spare = all pins knocked down in two rolls
    Spare scoring = 10 + # of pins knocked down on next roll
Strike = all 10 pins knocked down in one roll.
    Strike scorring = 10 + # of pins knocked down on next two rolls
A spare or strike in the final frame gives the bowler one or two extra rolls respectively
